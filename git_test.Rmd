Hi JC! :)

Hi! Let's do some git collaborating! Can you modify the theme below?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) +
  geom_point() + 
  labs(x = "Mileage (miles per gallon)",
       y = "Displacement (Engine size; cc)",
       title = "Car info")
```

This graph is so beautiful, imma cry. T_T

ADDING RANDOM STUFF LOL
